# SDL2 Starter Template

A simple starter project for SDL2, designed to seamlessly work with VSCode out of the box. Additionally, it can be configured with CMake, making it compatible with any text editor.

## Motivation

I created this template to facilitate a smooth development experience across both Mac and Windows platforms.

## Requirements

- CMake

## Future Features

- Integration of Python into the starter template for easy python scripting
- Out-of-the-box support for Emscripten (WebAssembly)
